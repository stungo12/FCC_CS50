# FCC_CS50
Using FreeCodeCamp and Harvard's CS50 lesson on HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript

CS50 is a course from Harvard and freeCodeCamp (FCC) to help people get started with coding websites. I am not entirely interested in building websites, but the
course also deals with security and using Python which are why I started it. Now that I have spent a few hours taking the course, I've warmed up a little to the
possibility of me developing websites, as it seems like it could be quite fun, especially when you can do both front and backend development. If you want to
check out the course for yourself, you can find the link [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-web-development-from-harvard-university-cs50/).



Ran into an issue at 6:49:53. Here, we are learning about creating a program that uses SQLite to store flight information. Basically, we have our Django/Python
program that enters our airport information (JFK, New York) into SQLite and so that we can retrieve it. However, when I try to use it to link two airports
together and then save the information, then it gives the following error:
      ValueError: save() prohibited to prevent data loss due to unsaved related object 'origin'.
