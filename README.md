Using FreeCodeCamp and Harvard's CS50 lesson on HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript


Ran into an issue at 6:49:53. Here, we are learning about creating a program that uses SQLite to store flight information. Basically, we have our Django/Python
program that enters our airport information (JFK, New York) into SQLite and so that we can retrieve it. However, when I try to use it to link two airports
together and then save the information, then it gives the following error:
      ValueError: save() prohibited to prevent data loss due to unsaved related object 'origin'.
