# FCC_CS50
Using FreeCodeCamp and Harvard's CS50 lesson on HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript

CS50 is a program that is shared by Harvard and I'm not sure if they are running on freeCodeCamp (FCC), or if FCC is just taking the course and reposting it on
their website, but the course that I am following is on FCC's website {here}(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-web-development-from-harvard-university-cs50/)



Ran into an issue at 6:49:53. Here, we are learning about creating a program that uses SQLite to store flight information. Basically, we have our Django/Python
program that enters our airport information (JFK, New York) into SQLite and so that we can retrieve it. However, when I try to use it to link two airports
together and then save the information, then it gives the following error:
      ValueError: save() prohibited to prevent data loss due to unsaved related object 'origin'.
